      "question": "What is DCA?",
      "answer": "DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) is an investment strategy of putting a fixed amount of money into assets at regular intervals, regardless of price. The goal is to reduce timing risk and accumulate assets over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why choose DCA instead of timing the market?",
      "answer": "Market timing requires predicting tops and bottoms — most people fail at this. DCA skips prediction, focusing on discipline and time in the market to generate returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's in the sample DCA or Die portfolio?",
      "answer": "It includes high-quality Vietnamese and U.S. stocks, plus a few ETFs. The goal is to hold for the long term, not short-term trading."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much money do I need to start DCA?",
      "answer": "Any amount works — even a few hundred thousand VND per month. The key is consistency and choosing good assets."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I buy?",
      "answer": "Most people buy monthly to match their salary cycle. Others choose quarterly or based on their personal cash flow."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is DCA risk-free?",
      "answer": "No. DCA doesn’t remove the risk of holding an asset that declines long-term. Picking weak stocks can still lead to losses, so research and diversification are essential."
