  They alternate for variety in design.
  The 'btnExists' property is used to toggle the display of a button in these sections.
  When btnExists={true}, a button is displayed.
  This can be used to link to more detailed information or related resources.
  RightSection can also conditionally render one or two images based on the 'single' property.
  If 'single' is true, it displays one image, otherwise it displays two.
